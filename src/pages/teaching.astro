        <p class="intro-text">I began teaching at 21-years-old at Beijing Normal University. Since then, I have taught 30 courses (each for three credits over 15-week semesters) at nine universities in six countries to over 1,000 students. The courses span religious studies, anthropology, area studies, research methods and academic writing. They range from small PhD seminars to large BA survey courses, in person, online, asynchronous, floating in the ocean (Semester at Sea) and studying abroad (India, Vietnam, Japan and Mauritius).</p>

          <strong>TIBETAN CULTURE AND THE TIBETAN DIASPORA.</strong> I taught this course as part of a study abroad semester called Pitt in the Himalayas, owned by the University of Pittsburgh (USA). This was a four-month program housed at the Hanifl Centre for Outdoor Education and Environmental Study in Mussoorie, India. The syllabus focused on Tibetan refugees. I led students on treks and Tibetan Buddhist temple visits in Ladakh, on Tibetan Buddhist monastic schooling tours in Dehradun and to Tibetan refugee sites in Happy Valley. The syllabus closely integrated my own ethnographic fieldwork with Tibetans over the past 20 years.

          <strong>ANTHROPOLOGY OF RELIGION.</strong> I taught this course on Semester at Sea, a floating university owned by Colorado State University (USA). I designed the syllabus to follow our route around the world visiting 11 countries. Half of the course focused on Buddhism in Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, Mauritius and Vietnam. We surveyed everything from Buddhist new religiosity to queer Buddhist cinema to Buddhist political resistance.

          <strong>MAGIC, WITCHCRAFT AND RELIGION.</strong> I taught this asynchronous course at Appalachian State University in the USA. The syllabus focused on Buddhist and Hindu traditions in South Asia, in the diaspora and in the online cultic milieu. I drew on my own ethnographic material about witchcraft torment among the Gaddi tribe and conversion to Protestantism to combat spiritually-malign forces.

          <strong>ANTHROPOLOGY OF INDIA.</strong> I taught this undergraduate course while a visiting lecturer at Tokyo Metropolitan University. I also taught a weekly Area Studies Seminar called MODERN SOUTH ASIA. Both courses were designed as overviews of anthropological aspects of South Asian life, including Himalayan ecologies, popular culture, Dalit politics, Buddhist conversion and affirmative action politics.

          <strong>RACE, GENDER AND CLASS.</strong> I have taught this asynchronous course seven times at Appalachian State University in the USA. I designed the syllabus and revised it each semester to reflect the new scholarship and contemporary social issues. The course is designed as a broad survey that introduces critical themes and topics related to race, gender and class, including Japanese maid cafes and affective economy, Indian caste dynamics, and Vietnamese queerness.

          <strong>UNDERSTANDING CULTURE.</strong> I have taught this asynchronous course three times at Appalachian State University in the USA. I designed the syllabus and revised it each semester to reflect the new scholarship and contemporary social issues. I taught a related similar course, INTRODUCTION TO CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, at both Syracuse University (USA) and on Semester at Sea, a floating university owned by Colorado State University (USA). These courses are designed to be introductory classes for students with no previous background in anthropology.

          <strong>RESEARCH ENGLISH.</strong> I have taught several courses on academic writing and grant writing. As a Bachelor’s student, I studied English composition in addition to anthropology. Given the pressures of the academic job market, in the classroom I emphasize to students the importance of clear argumentative writing (for publications) and persuasive grant writing (for survival). In Japan, at Denki-Tsushin University in Tokyo, I taught the capstone undergraduate course. In China, at Beijing Normal University, I taught three graduate seminars of RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATIVE WRITING. While most of my students were Han Chinese, some were Tibetan and it was through learning about their experiences that I decided to study the Tibetan diaspora in India and pursue a PhD in anthropology.

          <strong>ETHNOGRAPHIC METHODS.</strong> I have taught several courses on social science and ethnographic methods. In Japan, at Tokyo Metropolitan University, I taught this course at the Master’s level. In Vietnam, at Vietnam National University, I taught an MA/PhD seminar called ETHNOGRAPHIC WRITING IN WESTERN ANTHROPOLOGY. In both classes, students learned both theoretical issues in conducting fieldwork and practical applications of specific note-writing and data collection techniques by doing limited fieldwork outside of class. In some cases, I accompanied students into their field sites (for example, Loving Hut restaurants associated with Supreme Master Ching Hai). These classes were designed as interactive workshops. Every semester I invite at least one of my research partners (either from Japan, Vietnam or India) and we co-lecture on the possibilities and difficulties of collaboration.

          <strong>ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORY.</strong> I taught this course to MA/PhD students at Tokyo Metropolitan University. I designed the syllabus to be theoretical interventions into their research projects. As such, each week we studied theory relevant to a specific student’s project. Readings encompassed ritual theory, martial arts studies, phenomenology, ethno-sexual frontiers and religious waste, among others.

          <strong>CULTURAL CHANGE.</strong> I taught this course on Semester at Sea, a floating university owned by Colorado State University (USA). I designed the syllabus to follow our route around the world visiting 11 countries. The focus was on globalization and transnationalism. The largest unit focused on Buddhist ethnopolitical violence (the Gorkhas of Darjeeling) in their multi-decade pursuit for political recognition as animist tribal people deserving of affirmative action rights. Other units similarly considered Buddhism in other contemporary contexts: for example, Japanese religious change in the context of anomie, social isolation, shrinking demographics and natural disasters; and Vietnamese queer Buddhism. The course was designed to survey various aspects of cultural change pertaining to our study abroad experience.

          <strong>FORCED FLIGHT AND MIGRATION.</strong> I taught this course at the University of Bremen in the Department of Anthropology. It focused on how displacement produces both human suffering and new possibilities of subjectivity and ethnic consciousness; new modes of sociality; and new modes of structural accommodation and resistance amidst heightened precarity. The course almost entirely focused on Buddhist refugee groups: Tibetans in India, Lhotshampa (Bhutanese) refugees in Nepal, Vietnamese refugees in Germany and Laotian Hmong refugees in the USA.

          <strong>TRIBAL IDENTITY IN THE HIMALAYAS.</strong> I taught this course as part of a study abroad semester called Pitt in the Himalayas, owned by the University of Pittsburgh (USA). This was a four-month program housed at the Hanifl Centre for Outdoor Education and Environmental Study in Mussoorie, India. The syllabus focused on tribal groups in Ladakh and the Western Himalayas and included several ethnographic visits that I organized and led so that students could have firsthand experiences.

          <strong>DIVERSITY IN THE MODERN HIMALAYAS.</strong> I taught this course at Syracuse University (USA). I built this syllabus while a late-stage PhD student. It surveyed the pluralism of Buddhist and Hindu populations in the contemporary context of migration, ethnic violence, the state, ritual change, rightwing populism, ecological degradation and changing pastoral livelihoods.
